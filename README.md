Note: The ontologies folder is now deprecated. All ontologies that are reusable across the project and beyond are stored in separate repositories, such as:
[ContaminOSO](https://github.com/SAWGraph/contaminoso), 
[FIO](https://github.com/SAWGraph/fio)

Ontologies specific to a dataset are to be stored in the "ontologies" subfolder for the dataset. E.g. the ontology for Maine's EGAD dataset is located: [datasets/maine/egad/ontology/](datasets/maine/egad/ontology/)
The folders for each dataset further contains any metadata documentation and scripts developed to populate the knowledge graph. Raw data is not shared here but only linked to.

Guidelines, including naming conventions, for all ontologies are collected [here](contributing-guidelines.txt)
