Each dataset has its own namespace, separate namespaces for TBox and ABox:
- lower case prefixes
- ABox with "_data" attached
@prefix me_egad: <http://sawgraph.spatialai.org/v1/me-egad#> .
@prefix me_egad_data: <http://sawgraph.spatialai.org/v1/me-egad-data#> .
@prefix us_wqp: <http://sawgraph.spatialai.org/v1/us-wqp#> .
@prefix us_wqp_data: <http://sawgraph.spatialai.org/v1/us-wqp-data#> .

Each namespace is its own named graph
